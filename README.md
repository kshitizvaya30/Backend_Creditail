# Backend_Creditail

In this project, we have implemented two APIs to facilitate the management of invoices. The first API allows users to retrieve all invoices from the database. By calling this API, users can access a comprehensive list of invoices and obtain important details such as invoice numbers, dates, and amounts.

The second API focuses on updating the pending amount in invoices. Users can utilize this API to modify the pending amount for specific invoices based on their requirements. This functionality proves useful in scenarios where invoices need to be adjusted or reconciled.

Furthermore, to ensure the reliability and scalability of our application, we have integrated a database connection with Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service). By leveraging Amazon RDS, we can securely store and retrieve invoice-related data. This cloud-based database service provides high availability, durability, and performance, allowing for efficient invoice management.

By combining these two APIs and the Amazon RDS database connection, our application offers a robust solution for invoice management tasks. Developers can seamlessly retrieve invoice data and update pending amounts while also benefiting from the scalable and reliable infrastructure provided by Amazon RDS.
